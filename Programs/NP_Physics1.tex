\section*{Introduction}
%
%========================================================================================================

Successful interaction of educational, organizational and methodological and scientific processes in higher educational institutions is the basis for the formation of a modern student, which provides the formation of a modern specialist with a full set of knowledge through the assimilation of all three components during the study period. Through this kind of work the student acquires skills of learning, assimilation, processing and use of new information.

Physics programs are based on one of the most advanced technologies -- the credit-module system, which ensures the improvement of the quality of education in the information society, the educational mobility of each student, the acquisition of self-realization and competitiveness in the labor market.

The discipline programs are aimed at maximizing the individualization of the learning process. The scientific and pedagogical staff of the department actively work on the new educational technologies of the educational process in accordance with the democratic values ​​of modern scientific and technological achievements of the Bologna process.

%The curriculum program <<\discipline>> is compiled in accordance with the educational-professional training program \okr{} training (specialties) \napriam{} (\spetsialnist).


The academic discipline belongs to the cycle of \cycle.


%========================================================================================================
%
\section{The purpose and tasks of the discipline}
%
%========================================================================================================

%========================================================================================================
%
\subsection{Purpose of the discipline}
%
%========================================================================================================

The basis of the credit-module technology of teaching disciplines \discipline{} are the following principles:
\begin{enumerate}
\item introduction of constant stimulation of independent learning by the student of educational material;
\item ensuring the regularity and continuity of training, increasing the value and objectivity of current and final control;
\item rejection of traditional forms of assessment of students knowledge, which strongly depend on the subjective approach of the teacher;
\end{enumerate}


In the study of academic disciplines, a comprehensive system approach to mastering the knowledge of the students, which allow timely adaptation to profound changes in Cyber Security technology, an increasing flow of information, and the latest scientific and technological advances in the field of information  technologies, is used.

%========================================================================================================
%
\section{Structure and main tasks of the discipline}
%
%========================================================================================================

The main forms of studying the discipline \discipline{} are lectures, practical and laboratory classes.

At lectures, students should familiarize themselves with the fundamental laws of nature, properties and structure of matter, to acquire physical theories, fundamental concepts and definitions of physical quantities, content of models, hypotheses, laws, principles, and to form a coherent modern physical picture of the world.

The material of the lecture by the teachers of the department is presented in the form of presentations using the technical means of study, which is provided by the department and the university as a whole. This form of lecture lecture provides an opportunity to provide students with broader and more in-depth information on the subject being studied, and also meets the modern requirements of innovative approaches in the methodology of teaching disciplines.

The practical lessons consolidate theoretical knowledge by solving problems and examples, assimilate the means and methods for solving specific problems from different sections of physics.

In laboratory classes, students get acquainted with the physical phenomena being investigated and laws to understand the essence of research methods, acquire the skills of assessing the technical means used in the experiment, the skills to establish the reliability of the results obtained, learn the ability to use statistical techniques and modern computer techniques for processing and analysis of the results of the experiment.

Individual work is done on teaching aids and textbooks. To facilitate students' independent work, the teacher defines the main and additional literature, provides methodological advice. Also, it is recommended for the individual work to use electronic versions of textbooks, manuals and textbooks, prepared at the department and presented in the university's library.

For the convenience of working out and raising the level of assimilation of material in the process of independent work, at the end of each section of each discipline, control questions and a list of recommended literature are submitted. The curricula for studying disciplines are aimed at increasing the level of mastering the lecture material, developing the scientific worldview, modern physical thinking and the skills of active independent educational, scientific, methodological and practical activities, forging the ability to put the experiment and conduct its analysis, develop the thinking and creative abilities necessary for the formation high level future specialist.


To study the discipline, \godyny~hours/\kredits ECTS credits are assigned.

\section{The criterion for evaluating students' knowledge}
%
%========================================================================================================


The criterion for evaluating students' knowledge is the systemicity of general-professional knowledge, skills and abilities.

The control of students' current progress is carried out using the electronic journal, which records assessments for all types of student work, and this is the evaluation of the work in the classroom in practical classes, assessments for performing independent individual work, the protection of laboratory classes, estimates for the calculation and graphic work, modular control works. Together for the semester the student will receive more than 20 marks. Current performance is estimated at the 60-point system. At the end of each semester, the curriculum provides for a score or examination, the results of which are evaluated by the 40-point system.
